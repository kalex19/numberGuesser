# Number Guesser: Mod 1

The project requirments were to build a game where two users can guess a number between 1 and 100, with the ability for the user to add custom ranges for increased difficulty of play. Both players' current guesses must be displayed, along with the final results of each match via a card UI. The card should have the name of the winner in the center with both player names above and how many guesses it took to get the correct guess below. Finally, each card has a delete button to remove the card. The game also needed to be fully responsive and usable down to screens/viewport width of 320px.

### EXTENSION: each card should display how long the match took

## Motivation

As a second project, Number Guesser expanded on previously developed HTML and CSS skills and now incorporated vanilla JavaScript. It further tested my ability to design a UI that perfectly matched the comp and was interactive with the user. The best part of creating this project was learning to work on a team with another contributor.
